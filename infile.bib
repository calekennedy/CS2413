hypercube. Finding bounds for the longest snake at each dimension has proven to be a difficult problem in mathematics and computer science. Evolutionary techniques have succeeded in tightening the bounds of longest snakes in several dimensions [Potter, 1994] [Casella, 2005]. This thesis utilizes an Iterated Local Search heuristic with adaptive memory on the snake-in-thebox problem. The results match the best published results for problem instances up to dimension 8. The lack of implicit parallelism segregates this experiment from previous heuristics applied to this problem. As a result, this thesis provides insight into those problems in which evolutionary methods dominate.},

that deals with finding the longest-possible constrained path that can be formed by following
the edges of a multi-dimensional hypercube. This problem was first described by Kautz in the
late 1950{\textquoteright}s (Kautz 1958). Snake-in-the-box codes, or {\textquoteleft}snakes,{\textquoteright} are open paths while coil-in-the-box codes, or {\textquoteleft}coils,{\textquoteright} are closed paths, or cycles. Snakes and coils have many applications in electrical engineering, coding theory, and computer network topologies. Generally, the longer the snake or coil for a given dimension, the more useful it is in these applications (Klee 1970). By applying a relatively recent evolutionary search algorithm known as a population-based stochastic hill-climber, new lower bounds were achieved for (1) the longest-known
snake in each of the dimensions nine through twelve and (2) the longest-known coil in each
of the dimensions nine through eleven.},

	abstract = {A major goal for researchers in neuroevolution is to evolve artificial neural networks ({ANNs}) that can learn during their lifetime. Such networks can adapt to changes in their environment that evolution on its own cannot anticipate. However, a profound problem with evolving adaptive systems is that if the impact of learning on the fitness of the agent is only marginal, then evolution is likely to produce individuals that do not exhibit the desired adaptive behavior. Instead, because it is easier at first to improve fitness without evolving the ability to learn, they are likely to exploit domain-dependent static (i.e. non-adaptive) heuristics. This paper proposes a way to escape the deceptive trap of static policies based on the novelty search algorithm, which opens up a new avenue in the evolution of adaptive systems because it can exploit the behavioral difference between learning and non-learning individuals. The main idea in novelty search is to abandon objective-based fitness and instead simply search only for novel behavior, which avoids deception entirely and has shown prior promising results in other domains. This paper shows that novelty search significantly outperforms fitness-based search in a tunably deceptive T-Maze navigation domain because it fosters the emergence of adaptive behavior.},
